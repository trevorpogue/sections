Flexible tree data structures for organizing lists and dicts into sections.

``sections`` is designed to be:

* **Intuitive**: Start quickly and spend less time reading the docs.
* **Scalable**: Grow arbitrarily complex trees as your problem scales.
* **Flexible**: Rapidly build nodes with custom attributes, properties, and methods on the fly.
* **Fast**: Made with performance in mind - access lists and sub-lists/dicts in Î˜(1) time in many cases. See the Performance section for the full details.
* **Reliable**: Contains an exhaustive test suite and 100\% code coverage.

See the GitHub page at https://github.com/trevorpogue/sections. See also the References_ section of these docs for more thorough documentation of all the interfacing methods for Section objects.

=========================
Usage
=========================

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sections

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_doc_examples.py
                    :start-after: sphinx-start-usage
                    :end-before: sphinx-end-usage
                    :dedent: 4


----------------------------------------------------------------
Attrs: Plural/singular hybrid attributes and more
----------------------------------------------------------------

Spend less time deciding between using the singular or plural form for an attribute name:

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_doc_examples.py
                    :start-after: sphinx-start-plural-singular
                    :end-before: sphinx-end-plural-singular
                    :dedent: 4

If you don't like this feature, simply turn it off as shown in the **Details - Plural/singular attribute settings** section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties: Easily add on the fly
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Properties and methods are automatically added to all nodes in a structure returned from a ``sections()`` call when passed as keyword arguments:

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_doc_examples.py
                    :start-after: sphinx-start-properties
                    :end-before: sphinx-end-properties
                    :dedent: 4

Adding properties and methods this way doesn't affect the class definitions of Sections/nodes from other structures. See the **Details - Properties/methods** section for how this works.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Construction: Build gradually or all at once
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Construct section-by-section, section-wise, attribute-wise, or other ways:

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_doc_examples.py
                    :start-after: sphinx-start-books-construction
                    :end-before: sphinx-end-books-construction
                    :dedent: 4

=============
Details
=============

--------------
Section names
--------------

The non-keyword arguments passed into a ``sections()`` call define the section names and are accessed through the attribute ``name``. The names are used like ``keys`` in a ``dict`` to access each child section of the root Section node:

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_doc_examples.py
                    :start-after: sphinx-start-names
                    :end-before: sphinx-end-names
                    :dedent: 4

Names are optional, and by default, children names will be assigned as integer values corresponding to indices in an array, while a root has a default keyvalue of ``sections.SectionNone``:

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_doc_examples.py
                    :start-after: sphinx-start-names-printing
                    :end-before: sphinx-end-names-printing
                    :dedent: 4

---------------------------------
Parent names and attributes
---------------------------------

A parent section name can optionally be provided as the first argument in a list or Section instantiation by defining it in a set (surrounding it with curly brackets). This strategy avoids an extra level of braces when instantiating Section objects. This idea applies also for defining parent attributes:

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_doc_examples.py
                    :start-after: sphinx-start-parent-names
                    :end-before: sphinx-end-parent-names
                    :dedent: 4

-----------------------------------------------
Return attributes as a list, dict, or iterable
-----------------------------------------------

Access the data in different forms with the ``gettype`` argument in `Section.__call__()`_ as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    menu = sections('Breakfast', 'Dinner', sides=['HashBrown', 'Fries'])

    # return as list always, even if a single element is returned
    assert menu('sides', list) == ['HashBrown', 'Fries']
    assert menu['Breakfast']('side', list) == ['HashBrown']

    # return as dict
    assert menu('sides', dict) == {'Breakfast': 'HashBrown', 'Dinner': 'Fries'}
    assert menu['Breakfast']('side', dict) == {'Breakfast': 'HashBrown'}

    # return as iterator over elements in list (fastest method, theoretically)
    for i, value in enumerate(menu('sides', iter)):
        assert value == ['HashBrown', 'Fries'][i]
    for i, value in enumerate(menu['Breakfast']('side', iter)):
        assert value == ['HashBrown'][i]

See the `Section.__call__()`_ method in the References section of the docs for more options.

Set the default return type when accessing structure attributes by changing ``Section.default_gettype`` as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_doc_examples.py
                    :start-after: sphinx-start-gettype
                    :end-before: sphinx-end-gettype
                    :dedent: 4

The above will also work for accessing attributes in the form ``object.attr`` but only if the node does not contain the attribute ``attr``, otherwise it will return the non-iterable raw value for ``attr``. Therefore, for consistency, access attributes using `Section.__call__()`_ like above if you wish to **always receive an iterable** form of the attributes.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Plural/singular attribute settings
----------------------------------------------------------------

When an attribute is not found in a Section node, both the plural and singular
forms of the word are then checked to see if the node contains the attribute
under those forms of the word. If they are still not found, the node will
recursively repeat the same search on each of its children, concatenating the
results into a list or dict. The true attribute name in each node supplied a
corresponding value is whatever name was given in the keyword argument's key
(i.e. ``status`` in the example below).

If you don't like this feature, simply turn it off using the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_doc_examples.py
                    :start-after: sphinx-start-plural-singular-disable
                    :end-before: sphinx-end-plural-singular-disable
                    :dedent: 4

Note, however, that this will still traverse descendant nodes to see if they
contain the requested attribute. To stop using this feature also, access
attributes using the `Section.get_node_attr()`_ method instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Properties/methods
----------------------------------------------------------------

Each ``sections()`` call returns a structure containing nodes of a unique class created in a class factory function, where the unique class definition contains no logic except that it inherits from the Section class. This allows properties/methods added to one structure's class definition to not affect the class definitions of nodes from other structures.

--------------
Printing
--------------

Section structures can be visualized through the `Section.deep_str()`_ method as follows:


.. code-block:: python

    library = sections(
        {"My Bookshelf"},
        [{'Fantasy'}, 'LOTR', 'Harry Potter'],
        [{'Academic'}, 'Advanced Mathematics', 'Physics for Engineers'],
        topics=[{'All my books'},
                [{'Imaginary things'}, 'Hobbits', 'Wizards'],
                [{'School'}, 'Numbers', 'Forces']],
    )
    print(library.deep_str())

Output:

.. code-block:: python

    ###############################################################################
    <class 'Section'> structure

    'My Bookshelf' = <root, parent>
        parent = None
        children = ['Fantasy', 'Academic']
        topics = 'All my books'

    'Fantasy' = <child, parent>
        parent = 'My Bookshelf'
        children = ['LOTR', 'Harry Potter']
        topics = 'Imaginary things'

    'Academic' = <child, parent>
        parent = 'My Bookshelf'
        children = ['Advanced Mathematics', 'Physics for Engineers']
        topics = 'School'

    'LOTR' = <child, leaf>
        parent = 'Fantasy'
        topics = 'Hobbits'

    'Harry Potter' = <child, leaf>
        parent = 'Fantasy'
        topics = 'Wizards'

    'Advanced Mathematics' = <child, leaf>
        parent = 'Academic'
        topics = 'Numbers'

    'Physics for Engineers' = <child, leaf>
        parent = 'Academic'
        topics = 'Forces'
    ###############################################################################

See the References_ section of the docs for more printing options.

--------------
Subclassing
--------------

Inheriting Section is easy, the only requirement is to call ``super().__init__(**kwds)`` at some point in ``__init__()``  like below if you override that method:

.. literalinclude:: ../tests/test_doc_examples.py
                    :start-after: sphinx-start-subclassing
                    :end-before: sphinx-end-subclassing
                    :dedent: 4

``Section.__init__()`` assigns the kwds values passed to it to the object attributes, and the passed kwds are generated during instantiation by a metaclass.

--------------
Performance
--------------

Each non-leaf Section node keeps a cache containing quickly readable references to attribute dicts previously parsed from manually traversing through descendant nodes in an earlier read. The caches are invalidated accordingly for modified nodes and their ancestors when the tree structure or node attribute values change.

The caches allow instant reading of sub-lists/dicts in Î˜(1) time and can often
make structure attribute reading faster by 5x, or even much more when the
structure is rarely being modified.

However, for structures representing lists/dicts with more than 1000 - 10,000
elements, the extra memory consumption that this technique uses may start to
make it not beneficial to use. It is therefore recommended to consider changing
the node or structure's class attribute ``use_cache`` to ``False`` for
structures in this range or larger. This can be done as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    sect = sections(*[[[[[42] * 10] * 10] * 10] * 10])
    sect.use_cache = False              # turn off for just the root node
    sect.cls.use_cache = False          # turn off for all nodes in `sect`
    sections.Section.use_cache = False  # turn off for all structures

The dict option for ``gettype`` in the `Section.__call__()`_ method is
currently slower than the other options. For performance-critical uses, use the
other options for ``gettype``.
Alternatively, if a dict is required just for
visual printing purposes, use the faster ``'full_dict'`` option for ``gettype``
instead. This option returns dicts with valid values with keys that also have string
representations of the node names, but the raw form of the keys are references to
node objects and cannot be referenced by the user through strings.
See the `Section.__call__()`_ method in the References section of the docs for more details on the ``gettype`` options.
