    # invalidated when the tree structure or node attribute values change.
    # Using the cache can often make structure attribute reading faster by 5x
    # and even much more. The downside is that it also increases memory used by
    # roughly 5x as well. This is not a concern on a general-purpose computer
    # for structures containing less than 1000 nodes or 10,000 nodes, although

        Run :meth:`get_nearest_attr <Section.get_nearest_attr>`. This
        returns attribute `name` from self if self contains the attribute in
        either the singular or plural form for `name`. Else, try the same
        pattern for each of self's children, putting the returned results from
        each child into a list. Else, raise AttributeError.

        For argument `gettype`, Setting to `'default'` uses the value of
        self.default_gettype for gettype. Setting to `'hybrid'` returns a list
        if more than 1 element is found, else returns the non-iterable raw form
        of the element. Setting to `list` returns a list containing the
        attribute values. Setting to `iter` returns an iterable iterating
        through the attribute values. Setting to `dict` returns a dict
        containing pairs of the containing node's name with the attribute
        value. Setting to `'full_dict'` is faster than `dict` and returns a
        dict containing pairs of a reference to each node and its attribute
        value. `'full_dict'` output is visually identical to `dict` for
        printing purposes, but it will contain all attributes even if some
        source nodes have duplicate names. The only downside to `'full_dict'`
        that the keys cannot be referenced by name like with `dict`, but all
        values() are still valid.

                        body above for explanation of what each value does.

                 object containing the attribute `name` formed from the nearest
